# Feature Roadmap

This document defines the phased implementation plan for EchoID. Each phase builds on the previous one. Phases are dependency-ordered — no phase requires features from a later phase.

|-------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **1** | Foundation | Auth, profiles, user search | High (infrastructure setup) |
| **2** | Core Messaging | Private chat, contacts, message pagination | High (real-time infrastructure) |
| **3** | Social Features | Message requests, blocks, typing, read receipts, presence, media | Medium-High |
| **4** | Group Chats | Groups, roles, settings, join requests, group nicknames | High |
| **5** | Moderation | Reports, admin dashboard (users, reports, bans) | Medium-High |

## Phase 1 — Foundation

**Goal:** Establish the project infrastructure, authentication system, user identity, and basic profile management.

### Backend Tasks

- [ ] Initialize Express.js + TypeScript project structure
- [ ] Configure MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- [ ] Set up environment configuration (dotenv + Zod validation)
- [ ] Implement global middleware pipeline (CORS, body parser, error handler)
- [ ] Create the `User` model with all schema fields and indexes
- [ ] Implement EchoID generation (`eid_` + 8 chars via nanoid)
- [ ] Build `AuthService`:
  - [ ] Registration with email only (hash password with bcrypt)
  - [ ] Optional username at registration; generate random username when omitted
  - [ ] Enforce single manual username edit policy
  - [ ] Email verification with time-limited codes
  - [ ] Login with email + password
  - [ ] JWT access token generation (15-min expiry)
  - [ ] JWT refresh token generation and rotation (7-day expiry)
  - [ ] Refresh token storage and revocation
  - [ ] Password reset (forgot + reset endpoints)
  - [ ] Logout (invalidate refresh token)
- [ ] Build `UserService`:
  - [ ] Get own profile (`GET /api/auth/me`)
  - [ ] Update profile (`PATCH /api/auth/me`)
  - [ ] Upload avatar (`POST /api/auth/me/avatar`)
  - [ ] User search by EchoID and username (`GET /api/users/search`)
  - [ ] Get public profile (`GET /api/users/:echoId`)
- [ ] Set up auth middleware (JWT verification)
- [ ] Set up validation middleware (Zod schemas per route)
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint (`GET /api/health`)
- [ ] Set up request logging (morgan or pino)

### Frontend Tasks

#### Project Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui
- [ ] Install and configure TanStack Query
- [ ] Install and configure Zustand
- [ ] Set up API client (Axios or fetch wrapper) with auth interceptor
- [ ] Implement auth state management (Zustand store)
- [ ] Set up `ThemeProvider` (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Set up `QueryProvider` wrapper

#### Next.js Root Middleware (Auth Routing)
- [ ] Create `src/middleware.ts` with authentication-based routing:
  - [ ] Read `access_token` cookie to determine auth state
  - [ ] Unauthenticated users accessing `/app/*` → redirect to `/login`
  - [ ] Unauthenticated users accessing `/admin/*` → redirect to `/login`
  - [ ] Authenticated users accessing `/login` or `/register` → redirect to `/app/chat`
  - [ ] Public routes (`/`, `/about`, `/features`, `/contact`, `/faq`, `/privacy`, `/terms`) → always accessible
  - [ ] Admin routes (`/admin/*`) → check user role, redirect non-admins to `/app/chat`

#### Root Layout & Route Groups
- [ ] Build root `layout.tsx` (providers, fonts, global styles — no navigation)
- [ ] Build root `page.tsx` (redirect: authenticated → `/app/chat`, unauthenticated → landing)
- [ ] Create four route group layouts:
  - [ ] `(public)/layout.tsx` — Marketing layout (MarketingNavbar + MarketingFooter)
  - [ ] `(auth)/layout.tsx` — Auth layout (centered card, minimal, no navigation)
  - [ ] `(main)/layout.tsx` — App layout (AppSidebar + content area + SocketProvider)
  - [ ] `(admin)/layout.tsx` — Admin layout (AdminSidebar + header + content area)

#### Public Marketing Site (`(public)` route group)
- [ ] Build `MarketingNavbar` component (logo, nav links, Login/Register CTAs)
- [ ] Build `MarketingFooter` component (links, copyright)
- [ ] Build landing page (`/`) — hero section, features overview, how-it-works, CTA
- [ ] Build About page (`/about`) — mission, team, platform story
- [ ] Build Features page (`/features`) — feature cards with icons and descriptions
- [ ] Build Contact page (`/contact`) — contact form + info
- [ ] Build FAQ page (`/faq`) — accordion-based Q&A
- [ ] Build Privacy Policy page (`/privacy`) — legal content
- [ ] Build Terms of Service page (`/terms`) — legal content

#### Authentication Pages (`(auth)` route group)
- [ ] Build `AuthCard` wrapper component (centered card with logo)
- [ ] Build Login page — email/password form with "Forgot password?" and register links
- [ ] Build Registration page — email, optional username, password, confirm password
- [ ] Add registration helper note discouraging real-name usernames for anonymity
- [ ] Build Email Verification page — OTP code input with resend timer
- [ ] Build Forgot Password page — email input form
- [ ] Build Reset Password page — new password form with strength indicator

#### Authenticated Application Pages (`(main)` route group)
- [ ] Build `AppSidebar` component (nav: Chat, Contacts, Groups, Profile, Settings, Support)
- [ ] Build user profile page (`/app/profile`) — view own profile, edit
- [ ] Build user search page/component
- [ ] Build public profile view (`/app/user/[echoId]`)
- [ ] Build settings page (`/app/settings`) — theme, notifications, account
- [ ] Set up protected route wrapper (`ProtectedRoute` component)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Public marketing site is accessible without authentication.
- Marketing pages render with proper SEO metadata.
- Authenticated users visiting `/login` or `/register` are redirected to `/app/chat`.
- Unauthenticated users visiting `/app/*` are redirected to `/login`.
- Users can register with email only, verify, and log in.
- Users can register without username and receive a random generated username.
- Users can optionally add phone later for recovery/security.
- Username manual edit is limited to one change.
- JWT tokens work correctly with refresh rotation.
- Users can view and edit their profiles.
- Users can search for other users by EchoID or username.
- Public profiles show only public information (no email/phone).
- All four layouts render correctly with proper navigation.

### Privacy-First Rollout Order (Task 2)

Apply these in order to minimize regressions:

1. Backend schema and validation changes for future users only.
2. Auth service/controller contract updates (register/login/profile).
3. Frontend auth forms and helper copy updates.
4. Profile/settings account fields (optional recovery phone, one-time username edit UX).
5. End-to-end and regression validation.

Notes:
- Existing test users can remain unchanged during this phase.
- New signup behavior applies to newly created users.

### Privacy-First Test Matrix

- Register with email + password, no username:
  - Expect crypto-random username generation.
  - Expect successful email verification and login.
- Register with email + password + custom username:
  - Expect normal account creation and verification.
- Login with email:
  - Expect success for active account.
- Login with phone (if phone exists on account):
  - Expect success.
- Add phone after signup from profile/settings:
  - Expect success and persistence.
- Username update (first manual change):
  - Expect success.
- Username update (second manual change attempt):
  - Expect rejection with clear error.
- Privacy copy:
  - Register page shows recommendation against real-name usernames for anonymity.

## Implementation Principles

1. **Phase gates:** Do not start a phase until the previous phase's acceptance criteria are fully met.
2. **Vertical slices:** Within each phase, build full vertical slices (backend endpoint + frontend UI) rather than all backend then all frontend.
3. **Test as you go:** Write tests for each service method and API endpoint within the same phase.
4. **Review points:** At the end of each phase, review architecture decisions and adjust the plan for subsequent phases if needed.
5. **Documentation:** Update this roadmap document as phases are completed (check off tasks, note any deviations).
